## Description

A configureable data manager component. Utilizes many of the data
components to build a complete paginated display of data as well as tools for
creating, editing, and deleting data.

In addition to the components used, this component provides functionality to
create, update, display, and delete any type of data. The component uses two main
properties to configure the display and control the data, a view, and a connection.

This component is recursive and can display child crud-managers on related data
types.
